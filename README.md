## BEMsim3D
Open-source code base of the SIGGRAPH 2023 paper, "A Full-Wave Reference Simulator for Computing Surface Reflectance." For details on the underlying simulation method and acceleration technique, please refer to the paper.

Our simulation code supports individual simulations on provided surface samples; it also supports grouped simulations on subregions of given surface samples, which can be used along with our "beam steering" technique for generating BRDFs corresponding to densely sampled directions.
